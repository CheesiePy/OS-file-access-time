Absolutely! Here's a polished `README.md` with a modern look, emojis for clarity, and structured sections that would look great on GitHub:

<p align="center">
  <i>Compare sequential vs random access performance using low-level Unix system calls in C</i>
</p>

---

## 🚀 Overview

This C project measures and compares the performance of **sequential** and **random** block reads from a file.  
It simulates disk access patterns using system-level calls (`open`, `read`, `lseek`, `fsync`, etc.) and reports the time taken to access files of increasing size.

---

## 🧰 Features

- 🔧 **Low-level I/O:** Uses raw Unix system calls (`open`, `write`, `lseek`, etc.)
- 📏 **Fixed block size (512 bytes)**
- ⏱️ **High-resolution timing** with `gettimeofday()`
- 📈 **Benchmark automation** with `test_runner.c`
- 📊 **Averages across multiple runs** for accuracy
- 📄 Clean CLI output & optional logging

## 📁 File Structure

```bash
.
├── main.c           # Main program: writes and reads a file sequentially and randomly
├── test_runner.c    # Automated tester: averages read times for various file sizes
├── testfile.txt     # Temporary file created during benchmarking
├── main             # Compiled binary for main.c
├── test_runner      # Compiled binary for test_runner.c
├── README.md        # Project documentation (you are here!)
```

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Unix/Linux system
- GCC compiler
- POSIX-compatible C standard libraries:
  - `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<fcntl.h>`, `<unistd.h>`, `<sys/time.h>`, `<string.h>`

---

## ⚙️ Compilation

```bash
# Compile the main benchmark program
gcc main.c -o main

# Compile the automated test runner
gcc test_runner.c -o test_runner
```

---

## 🧪 Manual Usage

```bash
./main <number_of_blocks>
```

🧱 Block size is always **512 bytes**, so:

```bash
./main 10000
# Creates and reads a ~4.88MB file
```

---

## 🔁 Automated Benchmarking

Use the test runner to perform 5 runs per file size and report **average** times:

```bash
./test_runner
```

🧪 Test Runner Block Sizes:
| Blocks       | Size (approx) |
|--------------|----------------|
| 1,000        | ~0.49 MB       |
| 10,000       | ~4.88 MB       |
| 100,000      | ~48.8 MB       |
| 1,000,000    | ~488 MB        |

---

## 📝 Sample Output

```bash
===== File Access Benchmark (Average over 5 runs) =====
Fixed block size: 512 bytes

--- Testing with 10000 blocks (4.88 MB) ---
Average Sequential Read Time: 5200 μs
Average Random Read Time:     14200 μs
```
